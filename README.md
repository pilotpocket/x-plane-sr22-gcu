# Remote SR-22 GCU panel for X-plane 11 with Torquesim SE-22 plugin

This is the remote Cirrus SR-22 panel for Torquesim plugin of X-plane 11. 
Panel app can run on the same computer as X-plane but the separate computer with touchscreen works best.
It is .net core 3.1 windows 10 app. 
The app contains code from [X-Plane connector](https://github.com/MaxFerretti/XPlaneConnector) for communications with X-Plane simulator.

Some panel buttons are not active and invisible buttons near knobs are used to turn them clockwise and counter-clockwise.

![Connection button](images/connection-button.png) Connection button opens the X-plane connection window. 
X-Plane network tab of the settings window shows the IP address that should be entered here. The default port usually works fine.
